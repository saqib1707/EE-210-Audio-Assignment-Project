A sample image is provided to you : sem_ic.jpg . You can use further images of your choice if you wish.
There are two Scilab codes included: The function 'conv_2D.sci' and the 'main.sce' script


1) conv_2D.sci


This is a function file which does not need to be modified. You can use it as a black box to find the 2D convolution between two 2D-signals. The inputs to the function are, the input image 'X' and the kernel 'H'. The output will be the resultant signal 'Y' after the convolution. You can call this function multiple times depending on how many times you are performing the convolution.


		

2) main.sce: 

You need to run only the 'main.sce' code and modify it as needed. It has comments to help you out.
It also includes an example of reading an image, finding its dft, plotting its magnitude spectrum and, finally, using this convolution function.
